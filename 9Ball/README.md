### A few things that I wanted to do differently...

i wanted to make an array of strings for the responses, and then
simply do phraseArray[random]
to retrieve the random response.
	   
UNFORTUNATELY, making a an array of strings is apparently
complicated in C++, since strings are already char arrays.
i would have to do something like char[][] 
and that's more complicated than it needs to be.

instead, I tried a switch statement here.
it works similarly to python, so thats a plus.
